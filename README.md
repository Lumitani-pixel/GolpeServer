# 🃏 GolpeServer

Server-side application for the Golpe automatic card game.
This server accepts connections from bots or real players and runs game logic for Golpe. It’s a personal project to learn Java and networked multiplayer systems — not finished yet!

## 📌 About

GolpeServer is the backend for an automatic card game called Golpe, designed for learning and testing. Multiple clients (bots or players) can connect to play matches with rules managed by this server. The project is written in Java using Maven.

## 🚀 Features

* Handles player and bot connections\
* Coordinates game state and turns\
* Manages game logic for Golpe\
* Provides a foundation for bots to play automatically

⚠️ Work in progress — core gameplay and networking still being developed.

## 🧠 Why This Project Exists

You created this to learn how network servers work, how to structure game logic, and how game clients and servers interact over connections. Aswell as learning how to use javafx.
